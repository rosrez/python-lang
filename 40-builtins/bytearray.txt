Sample run of bytearray.py

bytearray objects are mutable byte arrays that behave like other sequence objects,
i.e. support indexing, slicing, etc. They also support some string-like operations
like find(), replace(), split().

$ python bytearray.py 
Hello
Hello World
Found 'World' -- replacing with 'Stranger'
Hello Stranger
