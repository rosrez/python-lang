The program produces the following output.

a = 37
refcount of a = 9
b = a
refcount of a = 10
c = []
c.append(b)
refcount of a = 11
b = 42
refcount of a = 10
c[0] = 2.0
refcount of a = 9
del a

Every new reference increases the reference count. Every assignment to new value
or 'del' decreases the refcount.
